MeasurementValueLogging
========================

This application displays measurement values from various serial devices. It provides functionality to log those measurement values to a .csv file, which can be opened with spreadsheet software. Furthermore it allows the user to calibrate measurement devices using a linear function. f(value) = calibrated value, where f is the linear function.

MeasurementValueLogging aims to be a free and open source alternative to the software provided by `XLSmess <http://www.xlsmess.de/>`_.

This documentation has been created using `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/>`_, a powerful tool that makes it easy to create intelligent and beautiful documentation.
